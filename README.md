# Stock-market-prediction

To do this experiment we will be using Kaggle datasets called "DJIA 30 Stock Time Series".
There are a number of datasets different for each company. In this tutorial, I have only used the first dataset called "AABA_2006-01-01_to_2018-01-01". There are seven columns in the dataset which include Date, Open, High, Low, Close Volume, Name. 
However, for the sake of simplicity, we would only use Date and Close which is the closing price for this prediction purpose.
